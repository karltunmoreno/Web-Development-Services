## About The Challange 



### The Task:

A Passion Project to service the public in need of a coding web programmer. This site serves as a service site for web development services.

### Criteria:

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential coders previous work
WHEN I load their web site,
- THEN I am presented with the Web sites name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

### What was done.

My Web Development Services site with short bio of my recent achivements.

It also have links to Repos and projects I have done through links on site.

Thank you for taking time looking at this readme page.

Happy coding!
